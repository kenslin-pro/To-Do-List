# Overview
This is a basic To-Do-List I have created to demonstrate the use Visual Studio Code, Git, HTML, CSS and JS. The purpose of this projest is to further my skills as Software engineer and gain a deeper understanding of Javascript as a programming language.

The primary purpose of the software is to address a common need in my daily life: I often found myself juggling multiple tasks and deadlines, and I wanted to create a user-friendly solution to streamline this process.


The software  will allow users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.


Through this project I want to strive to maintain clean, well-organized code by using modular JavaScript practices, separating concerns, and following best practices.
